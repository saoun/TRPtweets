REFACTORING NOTES
In makeMagic()
we created a function called makeCircles which returns the circles array
and we assigned it to a variables called 'circles'
then we passed this variable to startForces()
inside startForces, we pass it to ticked();


Figure out why es6 works in 111-113 but not function(d){}

figure out force collision isn't working
and why toggle isn't working.
